        <li>1 package (1/4 ounce) active dry yeast </li>
        <li>2 cups warm water (110° to 115°)</li>
        <li>1-1/2 teaspoons salt        </li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>4 to 6 cups all-purpose flour</li>
       <li>2 cans (8 ounces each) tomato sauce</li> 
        <li>1-1/2 teaspoons grated onion</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon pepper</li>
        <li>4 cups shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese
            </li>
        <li>                4 ounces Canadian bacon, diced
                </li>
                <li>
                    1 package (3-1/2 ounces) sliced pepperoni </li>
<h3>PROCEDURE</h3>
  <ol>
      <li>In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Add oil, salt and 2 cups flour. Beat on medium speed for 3 minutes. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rest in a warm place for 10 minutes.
     </li>
     <li> Combine sauce ingredients; set aside. Divide dough in half. On a floured surface, roll each portion into a 13-in. circle. Transfer to two greased 12-in. pizza pans; build up edges slightly.
            </li>
     <li>Bake at 375° for 15 minutes or until lightly browned. Spread with sauce; sprinkle with toppings. Bake for 15-20 minutes or until cheese is melted.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </ul>
